# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz




I created a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* This quiz  ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it displays your score and gives the user the ability to save their initials and their score
  

I took some screnshot, see below.
